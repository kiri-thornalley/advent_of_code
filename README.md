# Advent of Code Solutions
A collection of my solutions for the annual festive coding challenge [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). Each day has two puzzles, testing algorthmic thinking, puzzle solving and (often) your patience. 

## Repository Layout
Each year has a folder, within it are each days solutions in a single file. 

## Notes
These solutions vary in elegance, almost certainly will not be the height of software engineering and most of these have not been refined for performance. 
They solve the puzzles, they just might not be the prettiest or fastest way of doing it - I've typically prioritised writing readable code over any clever party tricks.

One day I might choose to optimise my solutions and/or write unit tests or visualisations for these puzzles.
